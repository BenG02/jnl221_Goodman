		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following creative dataviz stories, and carefully consume it, both text and creative elements. Make sure you spend time fully with each element. Then, critique it. Below the instructions, you should write the name of the project inside an h3 tag, and write at least three paragraphs and insert them below inside three separate p tags. Don't forget to close your tags!</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these projects:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/" target="_blank">Data breach hacks</a>, Information Is Beautiful</li>
			<li><a href="https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/" target="_blank">Hip hop vocabulary</a>, The Pudding</li>
			<li><a href="https://drones.pitchinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Drones dropped in Pakistan</a>, Pitch Interactive</li>

		</ul>
		<p>Answer <i>at least</i> the following questions, and be thorough and detailed in your responses: Where is the data from in this project, and what dataviz/graphics/visual elements are used? What do you think is the key message of this dataviz project? Describe the different ways in which this dataviz project is effective at conveying its key message. Mona Chalabi talks about her dataviz projects being visceral, or having to do with deep, internal feelings rather than the intellect, in order to be memorable -- in what ways do you feel this dataviz project was visceral?</p>

		<h3>Hip Hop Vocabulary, by The Pudding</h3>

		<p> This project aims to sort hip hop and rap artists by the number of unique words used in their songs. The data is pulled from popular media company Genius, and this site publishes song lyrics while allowing the community to provide annotations and interpretation of lyrics that not everyone may understand. To display this data, a face chart was used to visualize the number of unique words (between 2,500 & 7,800) used within each artist's first 35,000 lyrics.</p>

		<p> Multiple dataviz elements are displayed by this graphic, with one major element being the clarity of the heading. The more appealing the heading, the more a reader will pay attention to the data in a chart, and the heading in this chart accomplishes this since it is large and straight to the point. It is placed perfectly above the chart, not blocking any data. Another key element is the amount of data used, as well over 100 artists were used here. The more information used the more compelling the chart becomes while demonstrating a trend in the data. For example, because so many artists were observed, a clear trend is depicted in which the majority of artists used between 3,500-5,000 unique words in their first 35,000 lyrics.</p>

		<p> I believe that the key message in this dataset is to show how older artists and hip-hop founders have used more unique words than rappers today. The message being portrayed was that artists in the 2010s on average used significantly less unique words than those from the 1980s-2000s. One element that portrays this message is the option to view individual artists. In this interactive chart, if you search a hip hop artist by name (for example, Drake), every other face will fade except for Drake's, which creates a pink circle around his face to clearly show his data. Using this tool, I discovered that the only active artist to break 5,000 unique words was K.A.A.N, a smaller artist from Maryland.</p>

		<p> Personally, I believe that this dataset was visceral since I am an avid hip-hop fan. Seeing these artists and being able to observe data from each one was interesting to me because of this, and because it struck my positive internal feelings of hip-hop, it was appealing to analyze something I was passionate about instead of reading a chart to gain intelligence.</p>





		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following datasets -- one of which we've used in the past -- to create one, fully complete Datawrapper chart or map, that reflects at least one finding from this dataset. Insert it below the instructions inside an iframe tag.</p>
		<p>Attributes of a fully complete Datawrapper chart: Hed, subhed, data source, alt text, legend, byline, any notes about data limitations or details, any annotations that you feel help convey your finding(s). Remember: your finding should be reflected in either your hed or subhed, and an explanation of your data (where it's from, what it collects, etc.) should be reflected in the other. You must choose colors from a color palette generator; you may not use Datawrapper's default colors.</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these datasets:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAtkOoa15IdWrdgNc-3rSP6in--SX8m-/edit?rtpof=true" target="_blank">Active duty troops</a>, Stimson Center</li>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RZ235-x4KYuyA7xQX-flOP-N5uvweIMh9qPh4FN2fLo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">NY data</a>, Mapping The Gay Guide</li>
		</ul>

		<iframe title="Active Overseas Troops in Italy and the United Kingdom, 2000-2020" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-KNmsf" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KNmsf/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="400"></iframe> 
  		
  		<p>When you're done with both parts of this homework, return to Blackboard assignment step #4, and follow the instructions to get this on your Github page.</p>
